  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I Ching:Life Guide is a Lifestyle app that offers classic I Ching guidance for daily reflection and decision‑making.
      We respect your privacy. This policy explains what data the app handles and how it is used.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No account, no sign‑in, no subscriptions, no ads.</li>
    <li>No analytics SDKs or third‑party trackers.</li>
    <li>Questions you type and the cast results are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> only.</li>
    <li>The app works offline. Network access occurs only if you open in‑app links (website, privacy policy) or choose to send feedback email.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data We Store On Your Device</h2>
  <p>The app saves your divination history locally (question text, date/time, and the resulting hexagrams). This is kept in the app’s sandbox (UserDefaults) and is not uploaded to any server.</p>
  <p><strong>Your control:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete individual records in the History screen (edit or swipe to delete).</li>
    <li>Remove all data by deleting the app from your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Do <em>Not</em> Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal identifiers (name, email, phone, precise location).</li>
    <li>No contact book, photos, camera, microphone, or calendar data.</li>
    <li>No behavioral analytics or advertising identifiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Optional Email Feedback</h2>
  <p>
    If you tap “Feedback” in Settings, your Mail app opens with a pre‑filled message to <a href="mailto:lidonghui11911@gmail.com">lidonghui11911@gmail.com</a>.
    For troubleshooting, the draft includes app version, iOS version, and device model. You can review and remove this information before sending.
    We only receive the email you choose to send; the app itself does not transmit any data in the background.
  </p>

  <h2>In‑App Web Pages</h2>
  <p>
    The app may open web content (official site or this policy) inside an in‑app browser. Visiting those pages may allow the website to collect standard server logs or cookies according to its own policy. The core app features remain fully offline.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have received personal data from a child, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your data stays on your device within the iOS sandbox. We rely on the security protections provided by iOS. Always keep your device updated and protected with a passcode/biometrics.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Local history remains on your device until you delete items or uninstall the app. We do not operate a server copy.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy as the app evolves (for example, if we add new features). Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above and publishing the new version at this URL.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about privacy or this app, please contact: <a href="mailto:lidonghui11911@gmail.com">lidonghui11911@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>Legal Notes</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    This app provides lifestyle guidance and educational content only. It is not medical, legal, or financial advice.
